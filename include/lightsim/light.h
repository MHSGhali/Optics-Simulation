 *
 * FLUX/SHAPE FACTORIZATION (the central anti-foot-gun):
 *   Every light stores its total RADIANT flux `phi_e` in watts, separately from
 *   a normalised spectral shape `s_hat` whose band integral is exactly 1.
 *   Spectral radiant intensity is therefore always phi_e * s_hat(lambda) * d(omega),
 *   and there is no other way to spell it.
 *
 *   A light specified in lumens is converted to watts by ls_watts_from_lumens()
 *   in the units layer BEFORE it reaches a constructor, so lumens are never
 *   stored and this file stays free of photometric constants entirely.
 *
 *   ls_light_finalize() re-derives the emitted flux from the light's geometry
 *   and asserts it matches phi_e. That catches the classic normalisation bugs
 *   (I0 = phi/4pi used for a spot, a two-sided area light emitting double)
 *   at scene-build time rather than as a plausible-looking wrong number.
