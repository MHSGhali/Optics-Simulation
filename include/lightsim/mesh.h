/* mesh.h — triangle meshes and the BVH that makes them affordable.
 *
 * WHY A MESH IS NOT A Prim
 *   Prim is a fixed-size POD copied by value into flat arrays and duplicated
 *   wholesale by ls_scene_clone for the editor's undo stack. There is nowhere
 *   in it to put a vertex buffer, and a raw pointer inside it would be shared
 *   by every snapshot and freed more than once. So a mesh lives out of line: the
 *   scene owns an array of Mesh pointers, and a Prim of kind LS_PRIM_MESH names
 *   one by index. The Prim still carries the material, the selection identity
 *   and the placement, so editing, picking and undo work unchanged.
 *
 * WHY THE GEOMETRY IS IMMUTABLE
 *   Vertices never change after ls_mesh_build. Placement lives on the Prim
 *   instead -- `c` translates and (ex, ey, n) is an ORTHONORMAL object-to-world
 *   basis -- so rays are transformed into object space rather than the mesh
 *   being transformed into world space. That keeps undo snapshots cheap (a
 *   100k-triangle mesh is refcounted, not copied 32 times) and lets the editor's
 *   existing rotation code turn a mesh by rotating those three vectors, exactly
 *   as it already turns a quad. Non-uniform scale is baked in at import, so the
 *   runtime transform stays rigid and `t` is directly comparable with the `t` of
 *   every other primitive.
 *
 * ACCELERATION
 *   Each mesh owns a BVH over its OWN triangles. The scene-level loop stays a
 *   linear scan over the (small) prim array, so this does not pre-empt the
 *   scene-wide BVH that scene.h reserves for M4 -- it just stops one imported
 *   model from costing 50k prim tests per ray.
