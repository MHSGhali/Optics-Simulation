/* spectrum.h — fixed-size sampled spectral distribution.
 *
 * UNIT CONVENTION (read this before touching any spectral code):
 *
 *   Every Spectrum holds a SPECTRAL DENSITY PER NANOMETRE.
 *   So an irradiance spectrum is W/(m^2 nm), a radiance spectrum W/(m^2 sr nm),
 *   a flux spectrum W/nm, and so on.  The band-integrated quantity is recovered
 *   by ls_spectrum_integrate(), which multiplies by the bin width in NANOMETRES.
 *
 *   Choosing per-nm (rather than per-metre) keeps values human-scaled and avoids
 *   the 1e9 factor that silently wrecks radiometric integrals.  Planck's law is
 *   expressed per-metre by physics convention, so ls_spectrum_blackbody()
 *   converts on the way in -- that is the ONE place the conversion happens.
 *
 * REPRESENTATION
 *   Fixed-size POD (float v[LS_NBINS]).  Never a pointer+count: this keeps
 *   Spectrum stack-allocatable, forbids allocation in the path-tracing inner
 *   loop, and lets the compiler vectorise the elementwise ops.
 *
 * DISPERSION  (rewritten for opticsim -- read this before touching the lens)
 *   Carrying all bins along one geometric path is valid only because every
 *   SCENE material here is NON-DISPERSIVE: wavelength changes the value of the
 *   BSDF but never the sampled direction.  That invariant is intact.
 *
 *   opticsim nonetheless contains a dispersive element -- the camera lens --
 *   and it is deliberately outside this system.  opticsim/lens.h traces the
 *   lens SEQUENTIALLY with a per-wavelength index from opticsim/glass.h, and
 *   never goes through Bsdf.  So the thing that forced a change was not a
 *   dispersive BSDF; it was that CAMERA RAY GENERATION became wavelength
 *   dependent.  Two rays leaving the rear element from the same sensor point
 *   at 450 nm and 650 nm are different rays.  Carrying 95 bins down one of
 *   them and depositing all of them is precisely how you erase the chromatic
 *   aberration the lens exists to produce.
 *
 *   Therefore: a camera path carries EXACTLY ONE wavelength (see
 *   opticsim/spectral.h), and a Spectrum is read at that wavelength with
 *   ls_spectrum_at() below.  Radiance along a path is a scalar, not a
 *   Spectrum; opticsim/trace.h owns that and the vendored integrator.c is
 *   deliberately not part of this repo.
 *
 *   If a dispersive material is ever added to the SCENE, this warning bites
 *   again and the whole all-bins approach has to go.  check-lens-purity in the
 *   Makefile exists to make adding one loud rather than silent.
