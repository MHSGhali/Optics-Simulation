/* units.h — the ONLY radiometric -> photometric conversion in the engine.
 *
 * Design rule (do not violate): every internal quantity is stored as a
 * radiometric Spectrum. No struct anywhere holds a photometric value, and no
 * accumulator carries a unit tag. Photometric numbers exist only as the return
 * value of the functions below, which are called at report/export time.
 *
 * Tagging scalars with a unit enum was considered and rejected: it lets a
 * photometric value enter an accumulator that is later scaled by a radiometric
 * BSDF, and nothing catches it. Making the photometric value unreachable
 * outside this layer prevents that error class structurally.
